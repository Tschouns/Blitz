===Physics Sim===
- Rigid body dynamics (unconstrained):
  x polygon centroid (center of mass in uniform density bodies) calculation
  x inertia and torque calculation, based on force applied to a specific point
  x angular acceleration and velocity calculation

- Contstrains:
  - basic collision detection (narrow phase)
  - AABB broad phase optimization
  - "world bounds"
  - rigid compounds
  - bearings
  - friction
  - "bounciness" / capacity to absorb mechanical force
  - springs
  - collision groups

- "Global forces"
  - air resistance
  - wind
  - buoyant force

===Display API===
- Evalluation and implementation of a reasonable display API (some lightweight managed DX10 or openGL wrapper...)
  - SharpDX?
  - SharpGL?
  - MonoGame?

===Camera===
  - Projection
  - Camera movement

==="Engine"===
- Reasonable game loop and game time management
  - Update loop
  - multiple rendering loops in seperate threads
  - "game state" buffer

===Animation===
- Sprite batch animation
- Rigged character animation
